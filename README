Debian installer module to ask which desktop environemnts to install.

This udeb provide an alternative to the d-i boot paramenter
desktop=something, which is passed to tasksel when deciding which
desktop environment to install.

The menu entry should show up after network-preseed (2100), and before
pkgsel which uses the tasksel/desktop value.
